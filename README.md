This is a simple react project created for the Northwest Chicago JavaScript group by Erwin Kehrt.

To use the project, simply clone to your machine, run 'npm install' 

Once the packages are done installing, run 'npm start'

The app will allow you to type in a name and address and that data will get added to a card style UI component and displayed on the screen.
